## About this repo

This is an experimental attempt to implement the MVVM architecture in a React.js project.  
My friends from the mobile development world have talked a lot about the benefits of using MVVM, like increasing the testability by separating an application's business and presentation logic from its user interface. So I'm giving it a try.
